CORS is man's basic necessity, I'm crying (figuratively) as I type this little help file that would change your life forever (given that you intend to do something awesome with this codebase).
The soul of this app is to convey data to the WooCommerce api, and cors is uber-important for making that happen.

But alas!

Browsers hate cors...

It took me a whole day (no kidding) to find my way around this joy-killing, mood-swinging and heart-wrenching cors-y reality.
But it needn't take you that long.

On with it!

Put this code in your WP theme's functions.php (if the file doesn't already exist, just create it)

# snippet begins
function let_cors_live_sil_vous_plait() {
	remove_filter( 'rest_pre_serve_request', 'rest_send_cors_headers' );
	add_filter( 'rest_pre_serve_request', function( $value ) {
		header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *' );
		header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Methods: OPTIONS, GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE', false );
		header( 'Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true' );
		header( 'Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400' );
		return $value;
	} );
}
add_action( 'rest_api_init', 'let_cors_live_sil_vous_plait', 15 );
# end of snippet

When you've done that, go find this file in your woocommerce plugin directory: includes/api/class-wc-rest-authentication.php

You found it, great!

Now find this method in the class: perform_oauth_authentication()

Make the following code the first thing in the method block

#snippet begins
// in the spirit of enabling cors, let preflights pass
$http_method  = strtoupper( $_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] );
if ($http_method == 'OPTIONS') return true;
//
